🚀 Introducing Image Resizer for Instagram  

I’m excited to share my latest personal project: Image Resizer for Instagram, a simple yet powerful tool that adjusts images to Instagram’s aspect ratios with automated padding.  

I built this to help users avoid unwanted image cropping, and along the way, I deepened my understanding of HTML canvas.  

**Key Features:**  
✅ Multiple aspect ratio options  
✅ Customizable background colors  
✅ Bulk upload & download support  

**Tech Stack:**  
🛠️ Libraries Used:  
✔ jszip – For efficient file compression (https://stuk.github.io/jszip/)  
✔ bun – Lightning-fast JavaScript runtime (https://bun.sh/)  
✔ tailwindcss – For a sleek and responsive UI (https://tailwindcss.com/)  
✔ vite – Ensuring fast builds and optimized performance (https://vitejs.dev/)  


**Next Steps:**
✔ Enhancing mobile responsiveness for a seamless user experience across all devices
✔ Expanding background customization with gradients, patterns, and image-based options
✔ Adding more aspect ratio support, including Instagram Stories and Reels
✔ Optimizing performance for faster image processing and downloads
✔ Introducing individual aspect ratio selection per image
